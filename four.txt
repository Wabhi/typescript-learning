//if we want to make read only property for class then we need 'readonly' property

How can you shorten the following code in the best possible way?

class Product {
  title: string;
  price: number;
  private isListed: boolean;
 
  constructor(name: string, pr: number) {
    this.title = name;
    this.price = pr;
    this.isListed = true;
  }
}
