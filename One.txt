//what is TyPeScript ?
//why do we use TyPeScript ? and it's advantages ?

//TyPeScript is javascript superset of javascript, which is not a new programming language
//it is build up on top of JavaScript but with additional features like type checking and many more features.
//it is cann't execteable by browsers or even nodejs environment.
//it is a programming language and tools which is compile your TyPeScript file to javascript.

//TS=>JavaScript // even we didn't write the javascript file we just written it into TyPeScript.

//why do we use typescript.
//exp-1

function add(num1,num2){
    return num1 + num2;
}

console.log(add('1','3')) //13
//in this example we want to add two numbers and return a sum of add function and print information
//the console.log and we get 13 which is known because we know it's gonna concontate the string and
//but we want to print the sum of two number then we have to do some validation and then 
//we can be able to add but with the help of typescript we can do easily. typescript is 
//a tool which allows to developer write a more easy sintax, readable and type checking code 
//at development time. 

//tsc commond to compile typescript file to javascript file.

//advantage of typescript
//1. type checking code
//2. next-gen  js feature support (like const ,let & var)
//3. autocomplete in vscode editor
//4. prevent bugs before deploying application
//rich configuration options
